# windups docs

This is a React app that acts as documentation for the [windups](https://github.com/sgwilym/windups) library.

You can see the docs site in action at https://windups.gwil.co

Building that library and its docs was a solo project, and at a certain point my focus was getting it out the door â€” so this repo might seem a bit like a teenager's bedroom! Which is to say, some things in this code base are the way they are because I thought I'd be the only person to look at them.

That said it's an extensive example of a real world application of the windups library, with lots of little tricks to make the effect more user-friendly: stuff like auto-scrolling the page to keep up with text that's being typed out; animating character portraits next to text; special effects.

There is also a pretty full-fledged dialogue system in here that could probably be pulled out into its own family of components. Some day.
